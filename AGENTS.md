# Contribution Guidance

Before committing any code changes:

1. **Run tests** – execute `npm test` from the repository root. All tests should pass.
2. **Avoid duplicate exports** – when creating a new function, search the project to confirm it isn't already exported elsewhere. Duplicate exports are a common mistake.
