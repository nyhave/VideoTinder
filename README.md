# VideoTinder

VideoTinder is a minimal progressive web app (PWA) dating prototype. Instead of photos, users swipe through short 5â€‘second videos. A button allows inviting matches to a quick speed date.

## Features

* Drag left/right on short videos to swipe like Tinder
* Offline support via service worker
* Invite to video speed date
* New FaceTime-style speed date screen

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start a simple web server from the project root:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `public/index.html` in your browser.

Since dependencies are loaded from CDNs, no build step is required.
