The new **RealDatingApp** demonstrates daily video discovery, chat, reflection notes
and simple profile management powered by Firebase.

## Features

* Daily discovery of short video clips
* Basic chat between matched profiles
* Calendar for daily reflections
* Minimal profile settings and admin mode


## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start a simple web server from the project root:

3. Open `public/index.html` in your browser.
4. Sign up with your name to start swiping.

Since dependencies are loaded from CDNs, no build step is required.
