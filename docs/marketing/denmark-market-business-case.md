## Revenue Projection

- Premium conversion: **10%** of VideoTinder users -> **7,000 paying subscribers**
- App Store commission on subscriptions: **30%**
- Average income pr user pr year: 10% premium conversion × 70% net subscription revenue (after Apple's fee) + banner ads (300 impressions/user/month × 7 DKK CPM) = **91.6 DKK**

Annual revenue:
- Subscriptions: 7,000 Gold × 79 DKK × 12 = **6,636,000 DKK**
- Banner ads (bottom placement): 70,000 users × 300 impressions/user/month × 12 months ÷ 1,000 × 7 DKK ≈ **1,764,000 DKK**
- **Total:** **8,400,000 DKK**

## Cost Estimate

- Break-even total users (at 10% premium conversion): **100,000 users**

## Q1 2025 Revenue Example
An early projection for the launch quarter illustrates potential income with 10,000–20,000 users and a 5% premium conversion rate.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10,000 | 500 | 97 | 48,650 | 145,950 |
| 20,000 | 1,000 | 97 | 97,300 | 291,900 |
