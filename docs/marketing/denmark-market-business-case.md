## Revenue Projection
Assumptions:
- Expected market penetration for VideoTinder: **10%** of dating app users -> **70,000 users**
- Premium conversion: **10%** of VideoTinder users -> **7,000 paying subscribers**
- Tier distribution: **60% Silver**, **30% Gold**, **10% Platinum**
- App Store commission on subscriptions: **30%**
- Average income pr user pr year: 10% premium conversion × 70% net subscription revenue (after Apple's fee) + banner ads (300 impressions/user/month × 7 DKK CPM) = **69.6 DKK** (≈10 USD)

Annual revenue:
- Subscriptions: 4,200 Silver × 39 DKK × 12 + 2,100 Gold × 79 DKK × 12 + 700 Platinum × 139 DKK × 12 = **5,124,000 DKK**
- Banner ads (bottom placement): 70,000 users × 300 impressions/user/month × 12 months ÷ 1,000 × 7 DKK ≈ **1,764,000 DKK**
- **Total:** **6,888,000 DKK** (≈0.99M USD)

## Cost Estimate
- Infrastructure and support: **20 DKK** per user per year -> 70,000 × 20 = **1,400,000 DKK**

- Operational overhead (staff, legal, admin): **2,000,000 DKK**
- Payment processing (Apple App Store 30% commission on subscriptions): **1,537,200 DKK**

Total estimated annual cost: **7,937,200 DKK**

## Break-even Analysis

- Break-even total users (at 10% premium conversion): **120,000 users**

## Q1 2025 Revenue Example
An early projection for the launch quarter illustrates potential income with 10,000–20,000 users and a 5% premium conversion rate.

| Antal brugere | Betalende brugere (5 %) | ARPU (DKK) | Månedsindtægt (DKK) | Indtægt i Q1 (DKK) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10,000 | 500 | 99 | 49,500 | 148,500 |
| 20,000 | 1,000 | 99 | 99,000 | 297,000 |

This suggests a quarterly revenue range of **150,000–300,000 DKK**.
