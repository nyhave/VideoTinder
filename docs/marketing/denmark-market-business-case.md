Annual revenue:
- Subscriptions: 5,670 Silver × 39 DKK × 12 + 2,835 Gold × 79 DKK × 12 + 945 Platinum × 139 DKK × 12 = **6,917,400 DKK**
- Banner ads (bottom placement): 94,500 users × 300 impressions/user/month × 12 months ÷ 1,000 × 7 DKK ≈ **2,381,400 DKK**
- **Total:** **9,298,800 DKK** (≈1.3M USD)
