# Production Readiness Overview

This document summarizes the major topics that still need attention before RealDate / VideoTinder can be considered production ready for a large user base. It complements the existing [production checklist](production-checklist.md) and [risk analysis](risk-analysis.md).

## Security and Data Integrity
- **Input Sanitization**: User generated content (videos, text, chat) must be sanitized to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
- **Secure Secrets Handling**: Ensure Firebase and VAPID keys are stored as secrets in CI/CD and never committed or leaked in logs.
- **Admin Access Control**: Restrict admin screens to authorized users only and add authentication checks to Netlify functions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting in serverless functions to mitigate abuse.

## Build and Deployment
- Add automated code linting and tests to the build pipeline.
- Integrate detailed monitoring and logging (beyond manual log review) for both client and server.

## Testing and Continuous Integration
- Extend the GitHub Actions workflow to run the full test suite in addition to building and deploying the project.

## Payment Processing
- Payment integration is planned but not yet implemented. Robust handling of transactions and related security measures are required for launch.

## Additional Considerations
- Provide a license file and contribution guidelines.
- Plan for scalability, load balancing and disaster recovery.
- Review accessibility practices and add comprehensive analytics/monitoring.

This highâ€‘level overview should be revisited as the project matures to ensure all major production concerns are addressed.
