# Function Test Modules

The admin page includes a screen for manual function testing. The tests are now grouped so each module can be completed separately.

## Modules

1. **Discovery & Subscriptions** – daily clips, extra clip purchase, subscriptions and premium likes page.
2. **Chat & Reflections** – ratings, chat flow, match celebration and the reflection calendar.
3. **Profile Settings** – editing profile info, language preferences and interests.
4. **Recording & Media** – offline caching, recording limits, countdown timer and reveal animation.
5. **Admin & Statistics** – seed data, profile switching and various admin statistics screens.
6. **Account Access** – create profile, password reset and login flow.
7. **Invitations** – send invites, gift premium access and track invite status.

Use the admin menu to open *Funktionstest* and choose a module to start testing. Each feature within a module can be marked as OK or Fail with optional comments and screenshot. Submit results when a module is finished before moving on to the next.
