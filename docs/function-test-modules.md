# Function Test Modules

The admin page includes a screen for manual function testing. The tests are now grouped so each module can be completed separately.

## Modules

1. **Discovery & Subscriptions** – daily clips, extra clip purchase, subscriptions and premium likes page.
2. **Chat & Reflections** – ratings, chat flow, match celebration and the reflection calendar.
3. **Profile Settings** – editing profile info, language preferences and interests.
4. **Recording & Media** – offline caching, recording limits, countdown timer, reveal animation and PWA installation.
5. **Admin & Statistics** – seed data, profile switching and various admin statistics screens.
6. **Account Access** – create profile, password reset and login flow.
7. **Invitations** – send invites, gift premium access and track invite status.

Use the admin menu to open *Funktionstest* and choose a module to start testing. Each feature within a module can be marked as OK or Fail with optional comments and screenshot. Submit results when a module is finished before moving on to the next.

### Offline test

When verifying the **Recording & Media** module, open a profile while online, then switch the device to airplane mode. The previously viewed clips should continue to play and navigation should still work. Return online before continuing with the next module.
